  <h1>AI Moderator Idea for Reddit</h1>

  <p>It is a known and common problem that moderation on Reddit can be inconsistent, odd, and sometimes unreasonable. Mods often do not respond or explain what even happened, so you can understand for the future. It seems to me that one of the best and most fitting places to experiment with this is right here, in <span class="highlight">r/Singularity</span>.</p>

  <p class="highlight">This is not an attack on the mods:</p>
  <p>They donate their time to what must be a very hard and draining job. They are only human at the end of the day. This is to fix the shortcomings and make their lives easier.</p>

  <p>My basic idea is this: set up an AI system to assist in moderating. I do not mean "bots"; I mean something using GPT-5 or Gemini, or something similar.</p>

  <p class="highlight">I will now go into more detail. If you do not like this idea, please explain why. Even better though, explain how you would improve it.</p>

  <p>I will now explain piece by piece, as well as my rationale and reasoning.</p>

  <h2>1. Why AI?</h2>
  <p>Simple: Modern SOTA AI is very good at nuance, understanding rules, and just understanding in general. It is fair and even-handed if prompted to be. It is superhuman in speed and ability to synthesize and comprehend large amounts of information. It is also (generally) inexpensive compared to human effort.</p>

  <h2>2. Basic Implementation</h2>
  <p><strong>Basic Setup:</strong> Have AI look at posts, and maybe comments (why not, right?), to judge if they are following the rules and spirit of the subreddit. This is simple, just a judgment call. Additionally, give context about past posts/comments from the user, and maybe even from Reddit in general. Allow the AI to clearly explain its reasoning and, if appropriate, ways to improve.</p>

  <p><strong>More Detail:</strong> When it responds, it can explain in detail the violation and (possibly) have a small discussion with the offender. It can change tone to match the violation. For example:</p>
  <blockquote>"slur slur slur, he a worthless slur" would get a blunt and scolding response. Something like "Dreams of AI" that is in good faith but perhaps just too low quality or off-topic would get a warmer and more "understanding" response.</blockquote>

  <h2>3. What About the Human Moderators?</h2>
  <p>Yes, keep the mods: They can handle edge or uncertain cases, extreme action, and appeals. The AI can say "I am unsure, this is tricky" and hand it off to the mods. It can also say "This seems fine to me, but it is getting a lot of reports and downvotes" and also hand that off to the mods. Extreme actions and appeals go directly to the mods.</p>

  <h2>4. Technical Challenges / Difficulty</h2>
  <p>Power of many: I do not know, and do not pretend to know, how hard this would be to implement. However, r/Singularity has nearly 4 million users, and more niche, technical subreddits might have thousands of very skilled people. If some people volunteered to help the mods, I think this could be implemented just fine. Also, if Reddit itself got on board, I am confident it could be.</p>

  <p class="highlight">That is all. Please share your thoughts to make r/Singularity a better place.</p>
